About E-Wise: Your Path to Responsible E-Waste Management

Welcome to E-Wise, where we empower individuals and businesses to make informed, eco-conscious decisions when it comes to managing electronic waste (e-waste). Our mission is simple: "Be wise with e-waste – Make Every Gadget Count!" We're committed to revolutionizing the way we handle electronic devices, promoting recycling, repair, and responsible disposal, all while fostering a community that values sustainability.

Our Vision

In a world increasingly dependent on technology, electronic waste has become a pressing global issue. E-Wise envisions a future where every electronic device is handled with care and responsibility, minimizing its environmental impact. We strive to create a sustainable ecosystem where your old gadgets can find new life, and everyone can contribute to a greener, more sustainable planet.

How E-Wise Works

At E-Wise, we've designed a user-friendly platform to guide you through the e-waste management process. Here's how it works:

1. *Locating Nearby Facilities:*: We utilize a self-created dataset and employ Python to find longitude and latitude coordinates for entered locations, enabling us to pinpoint nearby repair and recycling facilities without using external APIs. Users can sort facilities based on their capacity to handle e-waste. The only API used is Google Geolocation which helps us find longitudes and latitudes of the place. 

2. The Marketplace: Our platform facilitates a marketplace where both users and e-waste facilities can log in. Users can upload products they wish to sell, setting their desired prices. Facilities can view these products and engage in acceptance, rejection, or negotiation with the user through a chat and video call feature. Developed using MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js).

3. *Questionnaire for Classification:*: Users have access to a weight-trained questionnaire designed to classify products as recyclable or repairable, aiding informed decisions about the disposal of electronic devices. Implemented using Python.

4. Carbon Footprint and Reward Points: Through extensive data collection, we determine the approximate amounts of valuable materials such as plastic, aluminum, and copper extractable from specific products. Users are rewarded with points based on the extracted metals, encouraging responsible disposal. Powered by MERN technology.
   
5. Education Initiatives: We emphasize education through two channels:
a)Website Education: Providing informative pop-ups, blogs, and DIY guides on e-waste management and safe disposal within the website using the MERN stack.
b)Email and Newsletter Education: Sending educational content via emails and newsletters, leveraging Python for effective communication and awareness.


Join us on the journey to create a smarter, greener, and more responsible world of electronic waste management. Let's make every gadget count, one device at a time. Together, we can be E-Wise!
